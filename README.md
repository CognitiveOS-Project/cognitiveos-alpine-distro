# cognitiveos-distro

CognitiveOS distribution image builder — produces bootable Alpine Linux based OS images for x86_64 and ARM64 (Raspberry Pi). Handles custom Alpine Linux ISO generation, Go binary compilation (cpm, cognitiveosd, cli, inference, core-mcp-bridges), overlay assembly, and image signing.

## Prerequisites

- Alpine Linux / Linux host with `apk` and `alpine-conf` (for `mkimage`)
- Docker (for cross-architecture builds)
- Go 1.24+
- Git

## Quick start

```sh
# Install mkimage
apk add alpine-conf

# Build x86_64 ISO
make iso

# Build Raspberry Pi image
make rpi
```

## Build structure

```
├── overlay/              # Files baked into root filesystem
│   └── etc/
│       ├── inittab       # Boot into cognitiveos-cli
│       ├── hostname
│       └── cognitiveos/  # Config files (config.toml, registries.toml)
├── packages.*            # Alpine package lists per architecture
├── scripts/
│   ├── build-binaries.sh # Orchestrate per-repo builds (make build)
│   ├── build-overlay.sh  # Assemble overlay from built binaries
│   ├── build-image.sh    # Run mkimage for any profile (--profile x86_64|aarch64)
│   └── sign.sh           # Checksums and GPG signatures
├── docker/
│   ├── Dockerfile.build  # Multi-stage Docker build environment
│   └── Dockerfile.release # Minimal runtime image
└── Makefile              # Top-level automation
```

## Development mode

```sh
# Build all Go binaries from sibling repos and prepare overlay
make install-local
```

Output from `make iso` / `make rpi` goes to `output/`. Run `make clean` to remove build artifacts.

Each Go component builds independently via its own Makefile:
- `cpm` — `make build` to `build/bin/cpm`
- `cognitiveosd` — `make build` to `build/bin/cognitiveosd`
- `cli` — `make build` to `build/bin/cognitiveos-cli`
- `inference` — `make build` to `build/bin/cognitiveos-inference` and `build/bin/cograw`
- `core-mcp-bridges` — `make build` to `build/bin/` (audio, display, gpio, network, serial, package)
